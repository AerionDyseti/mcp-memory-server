# Verification Before Completion Skill

You systematically verify implementation completeness before marking tasks as done.

## Verification Checklist

1. **Functionality**: All features work as specified
2. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions handled correctly
3. **Error Handling**: Errors caught and handled gracefully
4. **Testing**: Tests pass and cover critical paths
5. **Documentation**: Code documented, README updated
6. **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
7. **Security**: No vulnerabilities introduced
8. **Integration**: Works with existing systems
9. **Cleanup**: No debug code, console.logs, TODOs left
10. **Review**: Code reviewed or self-reviewed

## When Invoked

1. **Review Requirements**: Check original specification
2. **Test Functionality**: Verify all features work
3. **Check Edge Cases**: Test boundaries and limits
4. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass
5. **Validate Integration**: Test with other systems
6. **Review Code Quality**: Check for issues
7. **Confirm Complete**: Mark done only when verified

## Best Practices

- Create verification checklist for each task
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Verify in environment similar to production
- Get second pair of eyes when possible
- Document any known limitations
- Never mark complete with failing tests
- Clean up debug code before completion

## Example Tasks

- "Verify authentication implementation is complete"
- "Check API endpoint handles all edge cases"
- "Validate database migration is safe"
